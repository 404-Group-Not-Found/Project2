## Thursday 18 Jan Goals for ABF
* button for api calls to Zomato
* home/return/buttons for navigating through site on each page
    * is a navbar in order? I eliminated the jumbotron in a previous commit, this can of course be restored. It seemed too large for our needs right now but a subtle (even transparent) navbar might be a good option with typical "hamburger" (think three horizontal lines stacked on top of each other) dropdown menu to represent the buttons that move from each page to another AND show the restaurant "category" selection that we have discussed
* maybe consider a different button styling for the "login"
    * some kind of hover effect, color change, a different shape, etc.
* display restaurant images
    * button for specific restaurant categories
* some kind of message to show the login is “free”, or “easy” or noncommittal or whatever
* develop the ideal path that our users will follow:
    * will they be forced to login?
    * can you swipe freely to try the app before signing up?
